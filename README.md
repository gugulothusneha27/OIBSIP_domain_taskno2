## BMI Calculator Project Description

The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator is a simple health-based application designed to compute a user's BMI based on their height and weight. The project helps users determine their body weight category — underweight, normal, overweight, or obese — according to the World Health Organization (WHO) standards.

Key Features:

User Input: Accepts weight (in kilograms or pounds) and height (in meters, centimeters, or feet/inches).

## BMI Calculation: Uses the standard BMI formula:

 BMI =Weight (kg)/Height (m)**2

## 	BMI Classification: Displays the result along with the health category:

Underweight: BMI < 18.5

Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9

Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9

Obese: BMI ≥ 30​
